For this project we deliberated on whether or not we were going to pair code or mob code. In the end we decided that mob coding would be best and I'm glad we went that route. It was better for us seeing the differences in our skills as a group, and being able to see/talk to other while they coded/while I coded was eye opening and I enjoyed it.

- I created the get_user api input for getting user/patient information, changed migrations to have better data types, and made queries for get_user. Genessy and Shiran were a big help in getting it completed.

- Created complete_reservations, update_reservations, and cancel_reservations router endpoints. All of them return a 401 that states "login is required" if not logged in. And implemented queries for these api endpoints.

- Created a footer for the home page. We all had different ideas as to which page should get one, or if every page on our site should have a footer, but ultimately decided that just the home page will have one.

- I updated the update button/link on the current reservations page that leads you to the form to update said reservation. Changed it from a button to a clipboard icon. Also updated some CSS/styling/fonts on the page, and deleted some unused code.

- I updated the buttons/links for canceling and completing reservations, as well as fixed some CSS. Changed the buttons to an icons we thought would kinda make it noticeable for what they are. An red x and a green checkmark.

- We talked with Dalonte about building the PG Database that was in the lear card because somehow we skipped over that. Luckily it isn't mandatory, according to Dalonte.

- The group spent time going through our code, trying to make sure there weren't any unused variable, functions, or imports ect..

- Shiran completed his project with the zoom api and showed us how to use it, because now we have to a token from zoom to be able to access reservations as a whole.
